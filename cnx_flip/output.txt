method of adding percents
 the percent uncertainty in a quantity calculated by multiplication or division is the sum of the percent uncertainties in the items used to make the calculation
uncertainty
 a quantitative measure of how much your measured values deviate from a standard or expected value
precision
 the degree to which repeated measurements agree with each other
percent uncertainty
 the ratio of the uncertainty of a measurement to the measured value, expressed as a percentage
accuracy
 the degree to which a measured value agrees with correct value for that measurement
significant figures
 express the precision of a measuring tool used to measure a value
approximation
 an estimated value based on prior experience and reasoning
drag force


Stokes’ law
shear deformation
deformation perpendicular to the original length of an object
strain
ratio of change in length to original length
stress
ratio of force to area
deformation
change in shape due to the application of force
tensile strength
measure of deformation for a given tension or compression
Hooke’s law
proportional relationship between the force 
static friction
 a force that opposes the motion of two systems that are in contact and are not moving relative to one another
kinetic friction
 a force that opposes the motion of two systems that are in contact and moving relative to one another
friction
a force that opposes relative motion or attempts at motion between systems in contact
magnitude of static friction
magnitude of kinetic friction
order of magnitude
 refers to the size of a quantity as it relates to a power of 10
metric system
 a system in which values can be calculated in factors of 10
derived units
 units that can be calculated using algebraic combinations of the fundamental units
English units
 system of measurement used in the United States; includes units of measurement such as feet, gallons, and pounds
conversion factor
 a ratio expressing how many of one unit are equal to another unit
second
 the SI unit for time, abbreviated (s)
kilogram
 the SI unit for mass, abbreviated (kg)
meter
 the SI unit for length, abbreviated (m)
SI units 
the international system of units that scientists in most countries have agreed to use; includes units such as meters, liters, and grams
physical quantity 
a characteristic or property of an object that can be measured or calculated from other measurements
units 
 a standard used for expressing and comparing measurements
fundamental units
 units that can only be expressed relative to the procedure used to measure them
physics
 the science concerned with describing the interactions of energy, matter, space, and time; it is especially interested in what fundamental mechanisms underlie every phenomenon
classical physics
 physics that was developed from the Renaissance to the end of the 19th century
model
 representation of something that is often too difficult (or impossible) to display directly
modern physics
 the study of relativity, quantum mechanics, or both
quantum mechanics
 the study of objects smaller than can be seen with a microscope
law
 a description, using concise language or a mathematical formula, a generalized pattern in nature that is supported by scientific evidence and repeated experiments
scientific method
 a method that typically begins with an observation and question that the scientist will research; next, the scientist typically performs some research about the topic and then devises a hypothesis; then, the scientist will test the hypothesis by performing an experiment; finally, the scientist analyzes the results of the experiment and draws a conclusion
theory
 an explanation for patterns in nature that is supported by scientific evidence and verified multiple times by various groups of researchers
relativity
 the study of objects moving at speeds greater than about 1% of the speed of light, or of objects being affected by a strong gravitational field
